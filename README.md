**First App - Kode with Klossy Mobile App Development Camp 2022**

This project is a simple iOS app created during the Kode with Klossy Mobile App Development Camp 2022. It was my first experience building an app in Xcode, and it helped me understand the basic components and tools available for iOS development.

**Features**

-Image Display: The app includes an image of coding on a computer, showcasing a simple yet important aspect of app designâ€”adding visual elements.
